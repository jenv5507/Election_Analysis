**Election Analysis**

**Overview of Election Audit**

The purpose of this election audit analysis was to provide the results to the election commission.  While they wanted to know the winning candidate, we also had to code information for the county resutls.  I added for loops and if statements to determin the county vote outcomes and the largest county turnout.

 To get the totals for the county and the candidates, I setup a counter to gather the total votes.  In addition, I created a county and candidate list along with a dictionary for the county and candidate lists which you can see below.
 
total_votes = 0
-   Above is setting up the total votes counter.
   
candidate_options = []
candidate_votes = {}
-   Above is setting up the candidates list and the dictonary for the candidate votes.

county_list = []
county_votes = {}
-   Above is setting up the county list and the dictionary for the county votes.
